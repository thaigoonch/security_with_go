Electric catfish or Malapteruridae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes). This family includes two genera, Malapterurus and Paradoxoglanis, with 21 species.[1] Several species of this family have the ability to generate electricity, delivering a shock of up to 350 volts from its electric organ.[2] Electric catfish are found in tropical Africa and the Nile River.[3] Electric catfish are usually nocturnal and carnivorous.[2] Some species feed primarily on other fish, incapacitating their prey with electric discharges,[2] but others are generalist bottom foragers, feeding on things like invertebrates, fish eggs, and detritus.[4] The largest can grow to about 1.2 meters (3 ft) long, but most species are far smaller.[5][6]
